# Sound-Localization-Server

This is the server application for Sound Localization using Android devices. This runs on an Android device which communicates with other 4 devices running the client version. This receives data from the other devices and using the timestamp difference and offsets, calculated using Modified Christian's algorithm, determines the X and Y coordinates of the sound source.
